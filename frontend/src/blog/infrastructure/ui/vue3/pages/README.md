# Pages

## What is this?

A Page is a group of organisms that form a relatively complex component.
A page consists of two or more organisms and can be used in the router.
It is a structure formed by the combination of more than one organism. For example:

-   Home (the home page is formed by the combination of a header organism, a main organism and a footer organism.)
-   About (the about page is formed by the combination of a header organism, a main organism and a footer organism.)
-   Etc.

## How to use

Pages are used in the router.
