# Templates

## What is this?

Above all three stages (atoms, molecules, and organisms) are used to create templates.
We can think that templates are pages without any endpoint connection or business logic.
Aside from that, templates are usually created by using organisms. Sometimes, we might call molecules from templates.
For example:

-   Blog layout (the blog layout template is formed by the combination of a header organism, a main organism and a footer organism.)
-   Dashboard layout (the dashboard layout template is formed by the combination of a header organism, a main organism and a footer organism.)

## How to use

Templates are used in pages or in router as meta data for pages layout.
