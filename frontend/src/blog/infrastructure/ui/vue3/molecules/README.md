# Molecules

## What is this?

A Molecule is a group of atoms that form a relatively simple component.
A molecule consists of two or more atoms and can be used in organisms or even in other molecules.
It is a structure formed by the combination of more than one atom. For example:

-   Search bar (the search molecule is formed by the combination of an input and a button.)
-   Tabs (the tabs molecule is formed by the combination of a button and a list of buttons.)
-   Dropdown (the dropdown molecule is formed by the combination of a button and a list of buttons.)

## How to use

Molecules are used in organisms and them are not used directly in the pages.
Molecules are composed of atoms and other molecules.
